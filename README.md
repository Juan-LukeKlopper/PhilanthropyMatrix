# PhilanthropyMatrix

PhilanthropyMatrix is a blockchain-based project that harnesses the power of the Secret Network to create tokenized charity Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Our aim is to bring transparency, security, and trust to the charitable giving space through the innovative use of blockchain technology.

## Problem Statement

The current charitable giving landscape often lacks transparency, making it difficult for donors to track how their contributions are utilized. This lack of visibility can lead to decreased trust and engagement in charitable activities.

## Objectives

PhilanthropyMatrix aims to address these issues by:

1. Tokenizing charitable donations as NFTs, providing a clear and immutable record of each contribution.
2. Leveraging the privacy-preserving features of the Secret Network to ensure confidentiality where needed.
3. Building a user-friendly interface using the Svelte framework to make the process of giving intuitive and accessible.

## Project Overview

### Sub-divisions

1. **Contract**: This folder contains the Secret Network-specific CosmWasm smart contract written in Rust.
2. **Frontend**: This folder contains the user interface built using the Svelte framework.

## PhilanthropyMatrix for Hackathon

This project is a submission to the Secret III Hackathon. I believe that PhilanthropyMatrix demonstrates the potential of blockchain technology in enhancing transparency and trust in the charitable giving sector.
